# Using Skills

Learn how to find, install, and use existing Agent Skills.

## Finding Skills

### Official Examples

Browse the official skill examples on GitHub:

- [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) - Example skills from Anthropic

### Community Skills

Check community repositories and skill registries (coming soon).

## Installing Skills

Skills are just folders - "installing" means putting them where your agent can find them.

### Supported locations

Agents typically search these paths:

| Path | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md` | Project (OpenCode) |
| `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Project (Claude-compatible) |
| `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md` | Global (OpenCode) |
| `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Global (Claude-compatible) |

### Local installation

```bash
# Clone or download the skill into your project
git clone https://github.com/example/my-skill.git .opencode/skill/my-skill

# Or create from scratch
mkdir -p .opencode/skill/pdf-processor
# Add SKILL.md and other files
```

### Directory structure

Organize your skills in a dedicated folder:

```
.opencode/skill/
├── pdf-processor/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── code-reviewer/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── data-analyzer/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── scripts/
        └── analyze.py
```

## How Skill Discovery Works

### Walk-up discovery

For project-local paths, the agent walks up from your current working directory until it reaches the git worktree root. It loads any matching `skill/*/SKILL.md` in `.opencode/` and `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` along the way.

This means you can have:
- Repository-level skills in the repo root
- Organization-level skills in parent directories
- Personal skills in your home directory

### Discovery order

1. Current directory `.opencode/skill/` and `.claude/skills/`
2. Parent directories up to git root
3. Global `~/.config/opencode/skill/`
4. Global `~/.claude/skills/`

Skills with the same name in closer directories override those in parent directories.

## How Agents See Skills

### The skill tool

Agents are given a `skill` tool with available skills listed in its description:

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>pdf-processor</name>
    <description>Extract text and tables from PDF files</description>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>code-reviewer</name>
    <description>Review code for issues and best practices</description>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

### Loading a skill

When an agent decides a skill is relevant, it calls:

```javascript
skill({ name: "pdf-processor" })
```

This loads the full `SKILL.md` content into the agent's context.

## Configuring Permissions

Control which skills agents can access using pattern-based permissions in your agent's config file (e.g., `opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "allow",
      "pr-review": "allow",
      "internal-*": "deny",
      "experimental-*": "ask"
    }
  }
}
```

### Permission values

| Permission | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `allow` | Skill loads immediately |
| `deny` | Skill hidden from agent, access rejected |
| `ask` | User prompted for approval before loading |

### Pattern matching

Patterns support wildcards:
- `*` matches all skills
- `internal-*` matches `internal-docs`, `internal-tools`, etc.
- Specific names take precedence over wildcards

## Per-Agent Permissions

Give specific agents different permissions than the global defaults.

### For custom agents (in agent frontmatter)

```yaml
---
permission:
  skill:
    "documents-*": "allow"
---
```

### For built-in agents (in config file)

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "permission": {
        "skill": {
          "internal-*": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Disabling Skills

Completely disable skills for agents that shouldn't use them:

### For custom agents

```yaml
---
tools:
  skill: false
---
```

### For built-in agents

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "tools": {
        "skill": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When disabled, the `<available_skills>` section is omitted entirely.

## Using Skills in Practice

### Automatic activation

Most agents automatically detect when a skill is relevant:

```
User: "I need to extract text from report.pdf"

Agent: (Detects pdf-processor skill is relevant)
       (Calls skill({ name: "pdf-processor" }))
       (Loads SKILL.md into context)
       (Follows instructions to process the file)
```

### Manual activation

You can explicitly request a skill:

```
User: "Use the pdf-processor skill to extract text from report.pdf"
```

### Checking available skills

Ask your agent what skills are available:

```
User: "What skills do you have access to?"

Agent: "I have access to the following skills:
        - pdf-processor: Extract text and tables from PDFs
        - code-reviewer: Review code for issues
        - data-analyzer: Analyze CSV data files"
```

## Skill Permissions

### Script execution

Skills may include executable scripts. Consider:

- **Trust**: Only use skills from trusted sources
- **Review**: Check scripts before allowing execution
- **Sandbox**: Run in isolated environments when possible

### File access

Skills may need to read/write files:

- Grant minimal necessary permissions
- Be cautious with skills that modify files
- Keep backups of important data

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not showing up

If a skill doesn't appear in the available list:

1. **Check filename**: Verify `SKILL.md` is spelled in ALL CAPS
2. **Check frontmatter**: Ensure it includes both `name` and `description`
3. **Check uniqueness**: Skill names must be unique across all locations
4. **Check permissions**: Skills with `deny` permission are hidden from agents
5. **Restart agent**: The agent may need to rescan skill directories

### Skill not activating

```
Problem: Agent doesn't use the skill when expected

Solutions:
1. Check the skill's description matches the task keywords
2. Try explicitly mentioning the skill name
3. Verify the skill's frontmatter is valid YAML
```

### Script errors

```
Problem: Skill scripts fail to run

Solutions:
1. Check script dependencies are installed
2. Verify file permissions (chmod +x for bash scripts)
3. Check script path references are correct
```

## Validating Skills

Before using a skill, validate it:

```bash
# Using skills-ref CLI
skills-ref validate ./my-skill

# Check output for errors or warnings
```

### Common validation issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Invalid name format | Use lowercase and hyphens only |
| Missing description | Add description to frontmatter |
| Name mismatch | Ensure name matches directory name |
| Description too long | Keep under 1024 characters |

## Updating Skills

Skills are version-controlled like any code:

```bash
# If using git
cd .opencode/skill/my-skill
git pull

# Manual update
# Replace files with new version
```
