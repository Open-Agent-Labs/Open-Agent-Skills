# Quick Start

Create your first Agent Skill in 5 minutes.

## Where to place skills

Skills can be placed in project-local or global directories. Agents search these locations:

### Project-local (per repository)

```text
.opencode/skill/<skill-name>/SKILL.md    # OpenCode native
.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md     # Claude-compatible
```

### Global (user-wide)

```text
~/.config/opencode/skill/<skill-name>/SKILL.md   # OpenCode native
~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md           # Claude-compatible
```

> **Note**: The exact paths may vary depending on your agent. Check your agent's documentation for supported locations.

## Step 1: Create the skill folder

Choose where to create your skill:

```bash
# Project-local (recommended for project-specific skills)
mkdir -p .opencode/skill/my-first-skill

# Or global (for skills you want everywhere)
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skill/my-first-skill
```

## Step 2: Create SKILL.md

Create a file named `SKILL.md` inside your skill folder:

````bash
# For project-local
cat > .opencode/skill/my-first-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-first-skill
description: A simple skill that helps format markdown documents.
---

# Markdown Formatter

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user asks to format, clean up, or improve markdown documents.

## Instructions

1. Read the markdown content provided by the user
2. Fix any formatting issues:
   - Ensure consistent heading levels
   - Add blank lines between sections
   - Format code blocks with language identifiers
3. Return the formatted markdown

## Example

Input:
```text
#Title
Some text
##Subtitle
- item1
- item2
```

Output:
```markdown
# Title

Some text

## Subtitle

- item1
- item2
```
EOF
````

## Step 3: Verify the structure

Your skill should look like this:

```text
.opencode/skill/my-first-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

Or if using Claude-compatible paths:

```text
.claude/skills/my-first-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

## Step 4: Test your skill

Once the skill is in place, your agent will discover it automatically. You can verify by asking:

```text
User: "What skills do you have?"
```

Or invoke it directly:

```text
User: "Use the my-first-skill skill to format this markdown..."
```

## How discovery works

When you run an agent:

1. The agent walks up from your current working directory to the git worktree root
2. It finds all `SKILL.md` files in supported paths (`.opencode/skill/*/`, `.claude/skills/*/`)
3. It also checks global paths (`~/.config/opencode/skill/*/`, `~/.claude/skills/*/`)
4. Skill metadata (name and description) is loaded and made available to the agent

This means skills in parent directories are also discovered, enabling organization-wide skills.

## What's in a SKILL.md?

Every `SKILL.md` has two parts:

### 1. Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: my-first-skill      # Unique identifier (must match folder name)
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---
```

### 2. Instructions (the body)

Write whatever helps the agent perform the task:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples
- Edge cases to handle

## Quick reference

| Path | Scope | Use case |
|------|-------|----------|
| `.opencode/skill/<name>/` | Project | Project-specific workflows |
| `.claude/skills/<name>/` | Project | Claude-compatible project skills |
| `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/` | Global | Personal tools you use everywhere |
| `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` | Global | Claude-compatible global skills |
