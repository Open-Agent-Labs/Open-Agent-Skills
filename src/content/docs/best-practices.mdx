# Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to create skills that agents can use effectively.

## Writing Clear Descriptions

The description is how agents find your skill. Make it count.

### Be specific

```yaml
# Bad - too vague
description: Helps with documents

# Good - specific and actionable
description: Converts Word documents (.docx) to PDF format, preserving formatting and embedded images. Use when user needs to export or share documents as PDF.
```

### Include trigger keywords

Think about what users might say:

```yaml
description: Analyzes CSV data files to generate summary statistics, charts, and insights. Use when user mentions data analysis, CSV files, statistics, or wants to visualize data.
```

### Describe both what and when

```yaml
description: |
  What: Validates JSON files against JSON Schema definitions.
  When: Use when user wants to validate JSON, check schema compliance, or debug malformed JSON.
```

## Structuring Instructions

### Use clear headings

```markdown
## When to use this skill
## Prerequisites  
## Step-by-step instructions
## Examples
## Common issues
```

### Be explicit about steps

```markdown
## Instructions

1. First, check if the input file exists
2. Read the file contents using: `cat {filename}`
3. Process the content by running: `python scripts/process.py {filename}`
4. Return the output to the user
```

### Include exact commands

```markdown
# Bad
Run the processing script on the file.

# Good  
Run: `python scripts/process.py --input data.csv --output results.json`
```

## Managing Context Size

### Keep SKILL.md focused

| Guideline | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Main SKILL.md | Under 500 lines |
| Total token count | Under 5000 tokens |
| Reference files | Load on demand |

### Split large skills

If your skill is getting too long:

```text
# Instead of one large skill:
mega-processor/
└── SKILL.md (1000+ lines)

# Create focused skills:
text-processor/
└── SKILL.md (200 lines)

image-processor/
└── SKILL.md (200 lines)

data-processor/
└── SKILL.md (200 lines)
```

### Use references for details

```markdown
## Quick Start

[Basic instructions here - ~100 lines]

## Advanced Usage

For advanced features, see [references/ADVANCED.md](references/ADVANCED.md).

## API Reference

Full API documentation: [references/API.md](references/API.md).
```

## Error Handling

### Anticipate failures

```markdown
## Error Handling

### File not found
If the input file doesn't exist, inform the user and ask for the correct path.

### Invalid format
If the file format is not supported, list supported formats and ask user to convert.

### Permission denied
If access is denied, suggest checking file permissions or running with appropriate access.
```

### Provide recovery steps

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
Install required dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### "Connection refused" error
Ensure the service is running:
\`\`\`bash
./scripts/start-service.sh
\`\`\`
```

## Examples and Edge Cases

### Show input/output pairs

```markdown
## Examples

### Basic usage

**Input:** "Convert report.docx to PDF"

**Action:**
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/convert.py report.docx --output report.pdf
\`\`\`

**Output:** "Created report.pdf successfully"
```

### Cover edge cases

```markdown
## Edge Cases

### Empty input
If the user provides an empty file, return a warning instead of processing.

### Very large files
For files over 100MB, process in chunks to avoid memory issues:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/convert.py large-file.docx --chunked
\`\`\`

### Special characters in filenames
Always quote filenames to handle spaces and special characters:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/convert.py "my file (copy).docx"
\`\`\`
```

## Script Best Practices

### Self-documenting scripts

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
process_data.py - Process and transform data files

Usage:
    python process_data.py <input_file> [--format json|csv]

Arguments:
    input_file    Path to the input data file
    --format      Output format (default: json)

Requirements:
    pip install pandas

Example:
    python process_data.py data.csv --format json
"""
```

### Helpful error messages

```python
# Bad
raise Exception("Error")

# Good
if not os.path.exists(input_path):
    print(f"Error: Cannot find file '{input_path}'")
    print(f"Please check the path and try again.")
    print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Exit codes

```python
# Success
sys.exit(0)

# User error (bad input)
sys.exit(1)

# System error
sys.exit(2)
```

## Testing Your Skill

### Manual testing checklist

- [ ] Does the description accurately reflect what the skill does?
- [ ] Are all commands correct and working?
- [ ] Do scripts have proper error handling?
- [ ] Are examples accurate?
- [ ] Does it work with edge cases?

### Validation

Use the skills-ref tool:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

## Summary

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write specific descriptions | Use vague terms |
| Include exact commands | Assume agent knows context |
| Handle errors gracefully | Ignore edge cases |
| Keep SKILL.md focused | Cram everything in one file |
| Provide examples | Skip documentation |
| Test before publishing | Ship untested skills |
