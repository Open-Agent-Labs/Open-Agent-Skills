# Writing SKILL.md

The SKILL.md file is the heart of every skill. This guide covers everything you need to know.

## File Structure

Every SKILL.md has two parts:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
---

# Instructions go here...
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### Required Fields

#### name

A unique identifier for your skill.

**Rules:**
- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- Must match the parent directory name

```yaml
# Good
name: pdf-processing
name: data-analysis
name: code-review

# Bad
name: PDF-Processing    # No uppercase
name: -pdf              # Can't start with hyphen
name: pdf--processing   # No consecutive hyphens
```

#### description

Tells agents when to use this skill.

**Tips:**
- Be specific about what the skill does
- Include keywords that help agents match tasks
- Keep under 1024 characters

```yaml
# Good
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.

# Bad
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

### Optional Fields

#### license

```yaml
license: MIT
license: Apache-2.0
license: See LICENSE.txt
```

#### compatibility

Environment requirements (max 500 characters):

```yaml
compatibility: Requires Python 3.9+ and pdfplumber package
compatibility: Works with Claude Code and similar agents
```

#### metadata

Custom key-value pairs:

```yaml
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0"
  category: productivity
```

#### allowed-tools (Experimental)

Pre-approved tools for the skill:

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read
```

## Writing the Body

The body contains your actual instructions. There's no strict format - write whatever helps agents succeed.

### Recommended Sections

#### 1. When to use this skill

Clear criteria for when the skill applies:

```markdown
## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:
- User asks to process PDF files
- User mentions extracting text from documents
- User needs to fill PDF forms
```

#### 2. Step-by-step instructions

```markdown
## Instructions

1. First, identify the type of PDF operation needed
2. For text extraction:
   - Use the extract_text.py script
   - Handle multi-page documents by processing each page
3. For form filling:
   - Parse the form fields first
   - Validate input data before filling
```

#### 3. Examples

Show expected inputs and outputs:

```markdown
## Examples

### Extracting text

Input: "Extract text from report.pdf"

Steps:
1. Run: python scripts/extract_text.py report.pdf
2. Return the extracted text to the user

### Filling forms

Input: "Fill out form.pdf with name: John, date: 2024-01-15"

Steps:
1. Parse the field mappings
2. Run: python scripts/fill_form.py form.pdf --name "John" --date "2024-01-15"
```

#### 4. Edge cases

```markdown
## Edge Cases

- **Encrypted PDFs**: Ask user for password before processing
- **Scanned documents**: Warn that OCR may be needed
- **Large files**: Process in chunks to avoid memory issues
```

## Best Practices

### Keep it focused

Each skill should do one thing well. If your SKILL.md exceeds 500 lines, consider:
- Splitting into multiple skills
- Moving details to reference files

### Write for the agent

Remember your audience is an AI agent:
- Be explicit about steps
- Include exact commands to run
- Specify expected outputs

### Use file references

For detailed content, reference external files:

```markdown
For complete API documentation, see [references/API.md](references/API.md).

Run the main script:
\`\`\`bash
python scripts/main.py
\`\`\`
```

## Complete Example

```markdown
---
name: git-commit-helper
description: Helps write better git commit messages following conventional commits format.
metadata:
  author: example
  version: "1.0"
---

# Git Commit Helper

## When to use this skill

Use when the user:
- Asks for help writing a commit message
- Wants to improve their commit message
- Mentions "conventional commits"

## Commit Message Format

\`\`\`
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
\`\`\`

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation
- **style**: Formatting
- **refactor**: Code restructure
- **test**: Adding tests
- **chore**: Maintenance

## Instructions

1. Analyze the changes (git diff or user description)
2. Determine the appropriate type
3. Write a concise subject line (max 50 chars)
4. Add body if changes need explanation
5. Include breaking change footer if applicable

## Examples

### Simple fix

Changes: Fixed typo in README

Message:
\`\`\`
docs: fix typo in README
\`\`\`

### Feature with breaking change

Changes: Changed API response format

Message:

BREAKING CHANGE: Response structure has changed.
See migration guide for details.
\`\`\`
```
