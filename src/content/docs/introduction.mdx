# Introduction

**Agent Skills** is a simple, open format for giving AI agents new capabilities and expertise.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is just a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Instructions for the agent
├── scripts/          # Optional: code the agent can run
└── references/       # Optional: additional documentation
```

Think of skills as **"how-to guides for AI agents"** - they provide the procedural knowledge that agents need to do real work reliably.

## Why do agents need Skills?

AI agents are increasingly capable, but they often lack the specific context needed for specialized tasks:

| Without Skills | With Skills |
|----------------|-------------|
| Generic responses | Domain-specific expertise |
| Inconsistent workflows | Repeatable, auditable processes |
| Limited to training data | Access to custom procedures |
| One-size-fits-all | Team and project specific |

## Who is this for?

| Role | How Skills Help |
|------|-----------------|
| **Skill Authors** | Build capabilities once, deploy across multiple agent products |
| **Agent Developers** | Add skills support to let users extend your agent |
| **Teams & Enterprises** | Capture organizational knowledge in version-controlled packages |
